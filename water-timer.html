                In this group project we were required to create a 20 seconds water-based timer. 
                Our artifact was made out of a wooden board, moss, and copper pipes. 
                The white flowed from a container inside the main structure on the right in to the white verticle white tube. 
                This was inspired by the Japanese water feature “ShiShi-Odoshi” 
                (‘scaredeer’), which was traditionally used to scare away any animals that posed a threat to the agriculture. 
                The Shishi- Odoshi consists of a tube, trandisonally made out of bamboo, which is bottom heavy and therefore the 
                bottom part is down initially. When water is collected at the upper tip of the tube, the tube’s centre of gravity 
                finally shifts past the pivot, causing the tube to rotate. The water at that point are dumped into the moss covered container. 
                The heavier end then falls back against the back copper legg, creating a sharp noise, and the cycle is repeated. 
                In the moss covered container stands a copper pipe with a ping-pong ball at it’s top. 
                The pipe stands on a cork, so as the water level in the moss-covered container increases, 
                the cork rises and therefore the ping pol rises. Eventually, the pingpong ball hits the coper sheets behind it and thanks 
                to it’s spinginess, the copper ”push” the ball into which is dropped exectly into to the copper container at 
                the left of the artifact. This marks the pass of the 20 seconds.
